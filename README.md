This project is a demonstration of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which utilizes the Tavily API for web search capabilities. The server is designed to run in a standard input/output (stdio) transport mode.

## Project Overview

The MCP server is set up to handle web search queries using the Tavily API. It is built with the following key components:

- **TavilyClient**: A client for interacting with the Tavily API to perform web searches.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- A valid Tavily API key

## ‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE FOR WINDOWS:‚ö†Ô∏è

You'll need to install this on the *Windows* side of your OS. 

This will require getting two CLI tool for Powershell, which you can do as follows:

- `winget install astral-sh.uv`
- `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

After you have those CLI tools, please open Cursor *into Windows*.

Then, you can clone the repository using the following command in your Cursor terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/MCP-Session-Code.git
```

After that, you can follow from Step 2. below!

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and add your Tavily API key:
   ```
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. üèóÔ∏è **Add a new tool to your MCP Server** üèóÔ∏è

Create a new tool in the `server.py` file, that's it!

## Running the MCP Server

To start the MCP server, you will need to add the following to your MCP Profile in Cursor:

> NOTE: To get to your MCP config. you can use the Command Pallete (CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+P) and select "View: Open MCP Settings" and replace the contents with the JSON blob below.

```
{
    "mcpServers":  {
        "mcp-server": {
            "command" : "uv",
            "args" : ["--directory", "/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY", "run", "server.py"]
        }
    }
}
```

The server will start and listen for commands via standard input/output.

## Usage

The server provides a `web_search` tool that can be used to search the web for information about a given query. This is achieved by calling the `web_search` function with the desired query string.
